# Project-2-DSA-II
# Program Description:
The program simulates real-time event-driven programming. The program simulates customers utilizing up to 10 services. Once the services are full, the program places those customers in a FIFO queue. While the event-driven simulation occurs, the program will compute the analytical model. 

# Setup and Compilation:
1. Download and unzip the submission from eLearning on a Linux box in the multi-platform lab.

2. The submission includes:
testHeap.cpp
minHeap.hpp
minHeap.cpp
customer.hpp
customer.cpp
testFifo.cpp
Fifo.hpp
fifo.cpp
testStats.cpp
stats.hpp
stats.cpp
simulation.cpp
simulation.hpp
README.md
MakeFile

3.Environment: This program has been tested in the multi-platform lab and will run there.

4.Compiling. This program includes a Makefile at the command line in Linux, type make all. The
The program creates the executable main To run the program make sure to use the command 
./main

# Running the program:
User input: 
lambda (l) = 2
mu (m) = 3
M = 2

Output: All output goes to the console.
